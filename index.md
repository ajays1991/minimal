AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers. You can trigger Lambda from over 200 AWS services and software as a service (SaaS) applications, and only pay for what you use. The code is executed based on the response of events in AWS services such as adding/removing files in S3 bucket, updating Amazon DynamoDB tables, HTTP request from Amazon API Gateway etc.
